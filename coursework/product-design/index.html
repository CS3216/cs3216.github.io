Groupings for all assignments will be formed in the first week of the course.</p><p>This assignment is highly open-ended. We provide milestones so that we can grade your application in a consistent way, even though everyone will be building different apps. This assignment is also designed to introduce you to the various phases of app design, and the milestones are there to ensure that you learn about the elements in a structured way. We will also provide some related tips, references and a little bit of help to get you started. These milestones constitute 70% of the assignment&#x27;s grade.</p><p>While the milestones may be easy to meet, simply meeting them will not give you full credit. We ask for quality submissions, not run-of-the-mill work.</p><p>To score the coveted remaining 30%, use your creativity to design an application that stands out from the rest. We will not limit your potential by restricting the kind of applications you can build. We expect that you (pleasantly!) surprise us with what you are capable of doing.</p><p>Please do not hesitate to approach the friendly CS3216 staff if you need further assistance. We can be contacted at <a href="mailto:cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cs3216-staff@googlegroups.com</a>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="objectives"></a>Objectives<a class="hash-link" href="#objectives" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The objective of this assignment is to ideate and design an app that solves a real problem, and use empirical user testing to validate your idea and design. Your team will pick and target an audience to solve their problems. You will need to think critically about the features and user interactions within the product, and how each of these supports the user in solving the problem. Thereafter, you will interview users and use your user research and user testing data to iterate on the design and user interactions. The final product will be a high fidelity interactive prototype that is sufficiently detailed to be handed off to a developer and turned into a final working app.</p><div class="admonition admonition-caution alert alert--warning"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>Please read the entire assignment before starting.</p></div></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="terminologies"></a>Terminologies<a class="hash-link" href="#terminologies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In this assignment, we will use the following three terms when describing the designs we expect to see from you:</p><ul><li><strong>Wireframes:</strong> Low fidelity designs without any design-specific elements such as colours or fonts.</li><li><strong>Mockups:</strong> High fidelity designs that are <em>static</em>. These designs may look close to the final product, but they cannot be interacted with.</li><li><strong>Prototypes:</strong> High fidelity designs that are interactive, i.e. a user can click on a button, and the prototype will transition to the appropriate screen or state.</li></ul><p>We will also be asking for the submission of &#x27;user flows&#x27;. In traditional user interface (UI) / user experience (UX) circles, these refer to flow chart diagrams that represent each screen as shapes. However, we will instead refer to what <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NN Group</a> calls <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>wireflows</em></a> as user flows.</p><p>More information will be shared in the relevant sections.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="phase-0"></a>Phase 0<a class="hash-link" href="#phase-0" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>For this assignment, you will be designing and building a prototype that demonstrates your app&#x27;s user flows. There are a large number of available UX design tools in the industry, but we recommend using either <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a> or <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe XD</a>.</p><p><strong>Figma</strong> is a design tool that is available as a web application. Its most prominent feature is its support for real-time collaboration, allowing team members to work on the same wireframe, mockup or prototype simultaneously. Figma also has community plugins available for additional functionality, such as Iconify, which collates over 50,000 icons for use within your designs! Furthermore, students and educators can obtain a pro license from Figma for free.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/all</a></li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.figma.com/templates/</a></li><li>Export your designs out as a <code>.fig</code> file when submitting. <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040028114-Guide-to-exports-in-Figma#Export_in_bulk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instructions can be found here</a> at the very bottom.</li></ul><p><strong>Adobe XD</strong> is another powerful design tool that is able to convert your designs into interactive prototypes. These prototypes can be published onto an online link and can be run on mobile devices as a simulation of the real thing. However, Adobe recently stopped offering their free starter plan and switched to a 7-day free trial instead. If you&#x27;re keen on trying this out and/or you have an Adobe subscription, Adobe provides a lot of free XD resources and design templates that follow the latest design trends:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd/resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd/resources.html</a></li><li><a href="https://www.xdguru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.xdguru.com/</a></li><li>Save your designs locally as a <code>.xd</code> file and submit that.</li></ul><p>Apart from Figma and Adobe XD, here are some other tools you may choose from:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InVision</a>: Their free plan allows users to have one prototype with unlimited screens and unlimited collaborators for an unlimited period of time.</li><li><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch</a>: An industry standard, but it is not free and available only on macOS.</li><li>PowerPoint.</li><li>Paper and pencil for wireframe sketches.</li></ul><p>Whatever tool you choose, it has to be able to produce a prototype that fulfils all of the assignment&#x27;s requirements. In particular, the final prototype needs to be <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>demonstrate user flows</strong> through the app. Feel free to check with the teaching team if you are unsure about the tool you plan to use.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Milestone</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Milestone 0a (Compulsory, not graded):</strong> Describe your app in one paragraph.

These distract from the aspects that are more important at this current stage of development, and slow down the speed at which they are produced.

This may seem silly at first, but it is an important tool to validate your design at this stage. Here is a video that shows an example of this form of testing using paper prototypes.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_g4GGtJ8NCY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="playing-the-wizard-of-oz"></a>Playing the Wizard of Oz<a class="hash-link" href="#playing-the-wizard-of-oz" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>You may find it easier to conduct this form of testing in pairs. One of you will need to act as the computer, so you need a second person to record your results. Test with only one user at a time, not a group. This is to avoid one user&#x27;s actions and opinions from influencing the results of other users.</p><p>Ask them for five to ten minutes of their time, and if they agree, start by giving them a little context for what you are about to show them. For instance, if the app in question is NUSMods, you might tell them that they have just received a link from a friend telling them to check out a new app for organising their NUS timetable. You may also give them an explicit goal to accomplish, such as &quot;you would like to sign up for an account&quot;. They will need to achieve this goal by interacting with your wireframes. If you are conducting this virtually, the person acting as the computer can share their screen.</p><p>Instruct them to <em>think aloud</em> and use their finger to point at where they will click or tap, or if you are doing this virtually, you can try using the tools available on your conferencing application (Zoom has Spotlight and Arrow available under its annotations panel). A quick way to explain &quot;Think Aloud&quot; to your users is &quot;Vocalise your thoughts. Let us know what you&#x27;re thinking throughout the way&quot;. Explain that you will be acting the part of the computer, and reassure them that there is no wrong answer. Do also tell the user to notify you if they are done using the app / website or do not have anything else to do. This will make it clear to you when the user has totally lost interest, given up on your UI, or has no more use for your website / app.</p><p>Now show the first wireframe they are supposed to see. Observe what they interact with first, second, third, etc. Remember to &quot;transition&quot; between your wireframes as illustrated in your user flows as the user interacts with them. <strong>Do not</strong> say anything during the whole process. If users become lost or confused, <strong>let them be lost or confused</strong>. Only prompt them for what they are thinking if it appears that they are not thinking aloud. If they get stuck, simply move onto the next set of wireframes.</p><p>At the same time, keep an eye out for their body language. See if they looked hesitant or disinterested at any point in time. Perhaps, they had to squint and lean in to read certain text that was too small. A lot of times, the users will not report such issues as they would assume that the problem lies with them and not with your design.</p><p>For any buttons or screens that you have not designed, you can reuse any existing wireframes and tell the users what they should see - &quot;You clicked the <em>School of Computing</em> link. We don&#x27;t have those screens today. So please pretend that you see results for the School of Computing on this screen. Okay?&quot;. Alternatively, you can describe the result of the action to the user in words instead - &quot;You see a pop up open with a yellow warning triangle, the text &#x27;This will delete your results. Proceed?&#x27;, and the buttons &#x27;Okay&#x27; and &#x27;Cancel&#x27;&quot;.</p><p>Remain as neutral as possible during testing. Only ask follow-up questions <strong>after</strong> the user testing session is completely over. This would be your chance to ask:</p><ul><li>Did you notice button X on this screen?</li><li>Why did you click here and not there? What did you expect to happen when you clicked here?</li><li>You seemed lost on this page. Why were you lost? What did you expect to happen?</li></ul><p>Rinse and repeat with three to five<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> different users.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Milestone</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Milestone 6:</strong> Document the results gathered from this round of testing with three to five different users.

Keep the video short and sweet - give a short introduction about the problem your team is trying to solve before demonstrating the user flows. The video must be less than 5 minutes long and be submitted as a <code>.mp4</code> file.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Milestone</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Milestone 9:</strong> Finalise the prototype, record the demo video and save both of them under a new folder &quot;Final&quot;. Once again, since a prototype demonstrates the user flows, just submitting the prototype is sufficient.</p></div></div><p>We want you to be aware that the different milestones in Assignment 1 have been structured for you to gain a good sense of what it takes to produce a Product Requirements Document (PRD), a document used in companies (Facebook, Amazon, Google, many other tech companies...) to describe the product being built. The PRD is usually produced and has to be approved before further product development can take place. Once produced, it drives the efforts of the entire product team and the company&#x27;s sales, marketing and customer support efforts.</p><p>The broad structure of the PRD is as such:</p><ol><li><p>Product Purpose (Milestones 1-3)</p><ul><li>Description of the problem that you are trying to solve</li><li>High-level description of what the product does and how it solves the problem</li><li>Who is the product for</li></ul></li><li><p>Competitive Analysis (Not included in Assignment 1)</p><ul><li>Identify competitors who are launching similar products</li><li>Identify features of competitor&#x27;s products worth emulating or avoiding</li><li>Identify the ways in which our product&#x27;s features can deliver greater value than the competition</li></ul></li><li><p>Features (Milestones 4-8)</p><ul><li>Describe each feature at the level of interaction designs and use cases</li><li>Requirement traceability - identifying which requirements are in support of which objective</li><li>Metrics to be measured (Not covered in Assignment 1)</li></ul></li><li><p>Schedule for Product Development (Not covered in Assignment 1)</p><ul><li>Key milestones and overall timeline for product development</li></ul></li></ol><p>In particular, most of the PRD&#x27;s importance is in the articulation of the product purpose (Milestones 1-3) and the features built to serve its purpose (Milestones 4-8). This is also what we are focusing on in this assignment. Hence, besides being mindful of how and why Assignment 1 is structured in this manner, you should also illustrate (to the best of your ability) how each feature addresses a particular aspect of a problem that your target user faces - what is known as requirements traceability - to demonstrate that your feature was developed and iterated with thought for the problem faced by the target user and not simply because it&#x27;s cool or funky.</p><p>For further reading regarding PRDs during your free time, feel free to check out this <a href="https://svpg.com/assets/Files/goodprd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="phase-5---growth-hacking"></a>Phase 5 - Growth Hacking<a class="hash-link" href="#phase-5---growth-hacking" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Growth hacking is defined as the process of rapid experimentation across a marketing funnel, product development, sales segments, and other areas of the business to identify the most efficient ways to grow a business. A common misconception about the term is that it has to do with coding.</p><p>A wonderful application is useless if there are no users using it! In this section we will discuss some ways to get users.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="landing-page"></a>Landing Page<a class="hash-link" href="#landing-page" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When should you launch a website for your app? If your answer is to launch only after the app has been released, you are missing out! Just like movie trailers, which are released months before the actual launch of the movie, you can launch a landing page, which is a website designed to gauge interest and convert visitors into leads/users.</p><p>A landing page should:</p><ul><li>Explain what your app is about and aims to generate interest in it.</li><li>Contain a form that allows you to record a visitor&#x27;s information. Businesses often promise some sort of deal or promo for the first X users who sign up.</li></ul><p>Great examples of attractive landing pages can be found at:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 of the Best Landing Page Design Examples You Need to See in 2018</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Great Landing Page Examples You&#x27;ll Want to Copy</a></li></ul><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Milestone</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Milestone 10:</strong> Design and launch a landing page for your app that is publicly accessible. You should consider hosting it on <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub pages</a>, but you can host it anywhere that works and just let us have the URL. It should have a sign-up form for users to indicate interest (it doesn&#x27;t have to actually save any data).</p></div></div><p>Use a CSS framework like <a href="https://bulma.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> or <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> to save yourself some time. Remember that the design has to be attractive and that your message has to be succinct! You can even consider landing page creators like <a href="https://mailchimp.com/features/landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MailChimp landing pages</a> to skip all the work.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="marketing-strategy"></a>Marketing Strategy<a class="hash-link" href="#marketing-strategy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>A landing page cannot effectively convert visitors into leads/users if there are no visitors to begin with! Going back to the movie trailers example, it would be like creating a movie trailer but not showing it through public display screens and television advertisements. Hence, you should think of some potential marketing strategies to get the word out about your app.</p><p>Positive examples:</p><ul><li>Make promotional videos.

We want a well-thought-out marketing plan including details on how you would implement it. Your strategy must obviously be realistic, i.e. do not suggest giving out $10 to each user who downloads your app if you do not have a good plan of getting those funds or a millionaire on your team.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Milestone</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><strong>Milestone 11:</strong> Design a small marketing campaign for your app. Explain which marketing channels you would use and how you would use them to get the word out about your app to attract more users.
