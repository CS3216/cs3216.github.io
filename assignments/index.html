          </a>
          <p>
            In this assignment, students learn about the development life cycle of a web-based
            Facebook Application, learn to utilize the Graph API and choosing the suitable client-side and server-side
            development toolsets for building their application. Students are also encouraged to explore on related topics

            <h3>Assignment 2 - Application Seminar</h3>
          </a>
          <p>
            In order to build good and original applications, it is important to learnt what other people have already done â€” and think critically about what is good and bad, as well as explore ways to improve and to generate new ideas. In addition, it is important to learn how to articulate one's ideas in a clear and succinct way both orally and in writing. The application seminar is designed to help students both (i) gain a better understanding of existing applications; (ii) learn how to present (or sell one's ideas) and (iii) learn how to articulate their ideas on paper.
